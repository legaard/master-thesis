Project Brief / Direction
The digitalisation of money and banking has made people disconnected and unaware of their daily spendings, therefore we want to increase their economic awareness / consciousness by visualising the intangible interactions with money. This involves exposing people to their spendings (habits) through an artefact or system integrated in the home with the goal to make them reflect and thereby more aware and connected to their economic situation. An underlying conception is that people who are more economically aware are also more economically responsible.


We need to define economic awareness in a way that allows us to measure / determine / talk about whether people have become more aware of their economic situation.
How objective / subjective is economic awareness? Measurement vs. people’s own perception of their economic awareness.


Which financial aspects are most influential on people’s economic awareness?


Understanding the home as design context.


* How should we design an economic visualisation system for the home? 
   * How does it fit into the context?
   * What should the visualisation be like (metaphors)?
   * How do multiple users interact with the system?
        
Findings from interviews with the financial adviser and families, along with mock-ups and low fidelity prototypes afterwards will determine the direction of our project and which economic visualisation system we create. At this point we should know more precisely which related work to rely on and include in the report.

\section{Research/design approach}
#Talk about research through design
\chapter{Framing the Domain} (~10 pages)
#Introduction to the chapter
This chapter provides insights into the domains of personal financial management and technology for the home which constitute the main areas of interest in our thesis. The purpose is to create a general foundation…  
\section{Designing Technology for the Home}
The home is a dwelling place where inhabitants find refuge and safety; it is a place of security and protection where everyday cares fade and the things and people that one loves become the focus. It establishes a sense of belonging somewhere in the world and can have various physiological influences on the inhabitants, ranging from behavioral and emotional to even affect the overall mental health \cite{boutruche2008raising}. Designing technology for this context requires an understanding of the home as a ‘lived in’ environment where technology is used and integrated in numerous ways and where many different activities are undertaken. The home is a messy place where rooms often have multiple purposes and are configured by the inhabitants to fit their routines and specific needs. The challenges of designing for this context stand in stark contrast to the ones faced in the work sphere where information technology has been widely used for decades. Technology for the work sphere focuses on dedicated support of particular work activities that are isolated from the environment in which the systems are placed. As a consequence, the design techniques have focused on supporting the construction of dedicated systems for particular kinds of work rather than a broader consideration of the system and the space which it is used in \cite{hughes1998understanding}. For this reason, we must be careful not to use the familiar concepts derived from the workplace when designing for the home as there is a risk of migrating a set of values that may be inappropriate for the domestic context \cite{crabtree2003finding}. As Gaver phrases it \cite{gaver2001designing}:


\emph{“There is a danger that as technology moves from the office into our homes, it will bring along with it workplace values such as efficiency and productivity at the expense of other possibilities”}


Intuitively we know that the workplace and home are indeed very different domains, but the challenge is not simply one of understanding this, rather it is one of developing insights into how the home is different in order to create technologies that are fitting and appropriate to the setting. Hughes et al. have investigated the role of technology in the domestic environment with a focus on the home as a ‘lived space’ and how technology can be ‘made at home’ in such a setting \cite{hughes1998understanding}. They found an important theme to be the aesthetic character of the home, as it is an essential part of the transformation of a house into a home. Inhabitants work at their houses by decoration and configuration in order to make them into homes and these aesthetically focused ‘home making’ activities are of great importance to them as they encompass choices that reflect both personality and lifestyle. This emphasizes that the aesthetics are not to be taken lightly when designing technology for the home; it might even be a prerequisite that it is deemed aesthetically pleasing to be considered let into the home. However, there is a natural compromise between the aesthetic and functional traits of domestic technology. The more crucial the functionality is considered to be, the more willing we are to compromise on the aesthetics. In this regard, it is important to be aware of the close relationship that exists between the aesthetic and practical organisation of the home as these are closely intertwined \cite{hughes1998understanding}.
\subsection{Domestic Routines}
#Routines are very characteristic for the home. Cites from ethnographic studies that support this claim
#What is special about routines and why are they so prevalent in the home?
#Which kind of routines do people have? What activities are they related to?
#Designing for domestic routines → unremarkable computing?
#Remarkable computing answer. Maybe as part of next section?
\subsection{Ubiquitous Computing in the Home}
The domestic environment has received a great deal of attention from the ubiquitous computing community, especially through purpose built ‘lab houses’ that aim to explore both the potentials and shortcomings of current technology and infrastructure as well as visions of the future home e.g. \cite{kidd1999aware}. While exploring the potential of full blown ‘smart homes’ is an important endeavour, so is considering the constraints of the real world on the technologies we design. As Edwards and Grinter put it \cite{edwards2001home}:


“... new homes may eventually be purpose-built for such smart applications, existing homes were not designed as such. Perhaps homeowners may decide to "upgrade" their homes to support these new technologies. But it seems more likely that new technologies will be brought piecemeal into the home; unlike the "lab houses" that serve as experiments in domestic technology today, these homes will not be custom designed from the start to accommodate and integrate these technologies.”


This predicted piecemeal integration of technology into the home calls for research that complements the current holistic approach to domestic technology by considering how inhabitants might bring domestic technology into their ‘dumb’ homes. 
Rodden and Benford define three different approaches to the development of interactive domestic technologies. 


#Three key approaches for designing technologies for the home: Information Appliances, Interactive Household Objects and Augmented Furniture. Information appliances are standalone interactive artifacts that are completely self-contained with specific functionality. 


#Round off somehow: This is the kind of research that we are interested in and going to pursue in our master’s thesis by deploying domestic technology in the actual context?


#May belong to the section about domestic routines
Crabtree et al. have studied the domestic routines and activities, especially the ones related to the production and consumption of communication in the home and have found a set of key organizational features that may instruct the development and placement of technology in the home. The features include Ecological Habitats, Activity Centres and Coordinate Displays and represent the patterns of technologically mediated activity in the home \cite{rodden2004between}. Ecological habitats are places where technological artefacts and media live and where inhabitants go to find specific resources. The artefacts are placed in these ecological habitats as a matter of routine use and are thus easily located; habitats include places such as desks, shelves and tables. Activity centres are places where artefacts are recurrently manipulated and information transformed. Ecological habitats and activity centres may be different places but can also coincide; a noticeboard may at one time be a habitat for information about important upcoming events and at another a centre where the information supports social interaction. Likewise, the desk might at one time be a habitat where books, documents and reminders live and at another a centre where reports are written and emails sent. Coordinate displays are places where artefacts and media are displayed in order for inhabitants to coordinate their activities. They are constructed at easily visible sites with the purpose to trigger practical actions such as remembering to pay a bill or buy tickets for the match. An important point here is the fact that it might not be the same person who places the reminder to pay the bill and actually takes action; the displays act as ways for the inhabitants to coordinate action. Coordinate displays may also coincide with ecological habitats or activity centres. Taking the example of the noticeboard, it may act as a display for information that enables the inhabitants to coordinate social activities. As the examples indicate, it is important to remember that even though the three organizational features are distinct, the places in which they are situated often overlap, meaning the places will take on different functions at different times. The organizational features serve as conceptual and analytic resources to help guide the placement of domestic technology so it may meet the daily needs of the inhabitants. Identification of the ecological habitats, activity centres and coordinate displays in a particular setting, thus provides insights into prime sites for domestic technology deployment \cite{crabtree2003finding}.


#Unremarkable computing vs remarkable computing (might potentially get own section as it combines domestic routines and ubiquitous computing)


#Ethnographic studies offer insights into the routine nature of domestic life and technology use in the home
#Researchers have widely applied Mark Weiser’s vision of ubiquitous computing to the home with a focus on augmenting the environment with technology in order to support domestic activities within them. The quick progress of technology development in recent years has brought computers and internet into every home which created the foundation of a new field of research concerned with the “smart home”. 


#”Assembling the ubiquitous home”: Emphasize the importance of the spatial and temporal nature of technology use in the home. Space-plan and Stuff of the home are organizational features of interaction. This organization consists of the following three features: Ecological Habitats, Activity Centres and Coordinate Displays


#Future ubiquitous domestic environments are unlikely to be purpose built but more likely to evolve from our existing homes. As Edwards and Grinter argue: “new technologies will be brought piecemeal into the home; unlike the ‘lab houses’ that serve as experiments in domestic technology today these homes will not be custom designed from the start”


Many of these devices layer interactive functions onto existing household appliances often using touch screen technology…

\section{Personal Financial Management}
A significant amount of our daily decisions and routines are rooted in money. Everything from buying basic commodities to planning for buying a new house is weaved into our financial values and habits. Many commercial tools -- mostly apps \cite{mint,spiir,levelmoney,homebudget,moneylover} -- have been developed to support and engage people in personal finances, however the majority of these tools focus on extensive data visualization and/or economic planning which is proclaimed to fail in real-life situations \cite{snow2015fixing}. Also, since these tools are mainly deployed on multi-purpose platforms, such as smartphones or laptops, many applications are fighting for our attention once we engage with these devices and consequently users might find themselves roaming social networks, making phone calls or playing games instead of staying in touch with their finances \cite[p.~3894]{coleman2008nestegg}. Even though money is a substantial part of our life, financial management and interactions (e.g. saving, trading or buying) have not received much attention from the HCI community.
Kerber et al. created a household account book which is able to capture data from receipts using optical character recognition \cite{kerber2014towards}. This feature was used to ease the process of entering data, but aside from that their solution is not that different from today’s smartphone applications. A different and very interesting take on personal finances is the future-focused smartphone application Weekly \cite{weekly}. Based on a spending goal and daily transactions the application is able to provide users with a financial forecast, e.g. spending less money than planned results in a sunny forecast whereas spending more leads to a rainy forecast. A more physical approach to tracking finances is SmartPiggy; a smartphone-connected piggy bank which uses gamification to help users keep track of multiple saving targets \cite{stockinger2013smartpiggy}. Many similar products have been developed for commercial use \cite{ernit,kash,porkfolio}.\\
In 2014 Kaye et al. \cite{kaye2014money} conducted a foundational study where they investigated how people keep track of their personal finances. The study excluded financial professionals and people who systematically study finances and aimed to achieve general diversity in terms of age, income, assets, job and the presence of children and partners. In the paper the authors present three main findings: emotional reasoning for financial decisions, tools for tracking money and accounting for the unknown; the latter refers to the inability to predict future events that have an impact on personal finances and is not of interest to our project. According to Kaye et al. [ibid] most of our economic decisions are based on emotional grounds, which might not come as surprise (to some) since the notion of homo economicus, i.e. the idea that humans are self-interested actors who make economic decisions based on rational judgement, has been declared obsolete within economic theories \cite{REFERENCE}. The researchers found that people usually acted upon existing knowledge, prior experiences, worries, personal values and future dreams meaning that spendings are not always based on profit maximization or rational reasoning.
Their second finding is related to tools for tracking personal finances. In general tools were divided into two groups, namely paper systems and digital systems. The paper-based systems varied from simple index cards to more elaborate lists and calendars, and were often optimized for people’s financial focus (income, savings, stocks, etc.). Surprisingly the digital systems were not very popular. People expressed concerns regarding security and found the commercial aggregations systems (digital systems developed to provide a financial overview) somewhat frustrating mainly due to a poor user experience and lack of freedom. What is interesting here is that most people did not use a dedicated tool, however \emph{“people’s sense of their finances came from occasional glimpses at the complex whole, rather than a concerted and coherent overview of their entire situation...”} \cite[p.~562]{kaye2014money} meaning that people will occasionally review the last couple of transactions and look for anything that deviates from the expected. In relation to this Kaye et al. coins the term “financial touch” which is comparable to our definition of economic awareness, however their notion also includes temporality, i.e. having ephemeral or transitory financial interactions.
By the end of the paper the researchers come with some general thoughts and observations. First of all, none of the participants seemed to use systems that integrate all aspects of a financial life, suggesting a need for rethinking existing financial systems or create new interaction experiences. The varieties of physical (paper-based) systems used also shows a great potential for more physical systems. Furthermore, personal financial management tools could also include encouraging prompts and have a more granular approach to privacy, e.g. filtering content based on who is looking.\\


Despite the small number of HCI studies within the area of personal financial management, Kaye et al.’s article serves as a great starting point for this thesis. They point out that financial decisions are not solely based on rational reasoning and that being aware of one’s economic state is tightly coupled to the act of observing transactions patterns and looking for anomalies. As Snow and Vyas \cite{snow2015fixing} they also highlight the misalignment between commercially available products and actual financial practices, and foresee a high potential for more physical products. As their study was carried out in America, it might not be directly applicable to the European citizens and culture, therefore, in the next section, we describe a European study that segments financial customers based on their attitude and stance towards finances.


#Economic Awareness: knowledge, understanding and perception of financial interactions.
#FinTech has become the a hot topic in modern digitalized societies, however it seems to be difficult for HCI practitioners to keep up with the industry.
#Improve financial management
#Budgeting: an ephemeral activity which is often discontinued over time (create a baseline and do not deviate too much from it). One question is how to sustain a healthy economy once a budget has been created. Also, eliminating the need to spend time on manually provided information to the system.
\subsection{Segmenting Financial Customers}
\label{sec:segmenting-financial-customers}
This section presents information from a report developed by Forrester Research in 2006 \cite{ensor2006segmenting}. Although the report is more than 10 years old the data presented is still relevant today as it seeks to enlarge the traditional strategies for customer segmentation. In this thesis we will use this information as a way to understand and describe our participants’ financial motivation, behaviour and attitude.\\


According to \cite[ensor2006segmenting] the web has for many become the main source of information. Complex decisions are often based on knowledge obtained from the web and people regularly use online resources when researching for financial decision. Alongside this tendency many customers steadily adopt new service technologies leading to an increase in number of channels (phone, email, forms, etc.) used to reach the same goal. This increase is not only supported by our client’s data but it also shows that the mobile channels are on the rise compared to the more traditional platforms \REFERENCE TO FIGURE. To accommodate this change of behavior banks need to have an effective way of segmenting customers in order to reach a better understanding of customers’ decisions. Historically speaking customer segmentation is not new to most financial service companies, however the the current segmenting dimensions -- i.e. demographics, contribution, behaviour and attitude -- do not fully capture the complexity of customers’ behaviour. In general each dimension encompasses advantages and disadvantages, but the most useful and least ephemeral dimension is attitude since people's stance relation to economic change relatively slowly, it is applicable to all customers and it provides a valuable insight into people’s behaviour \cite[p.~2-8{ensor2006segmenting}.\\
Based on financial attitude customers can be divided into four different types. They are as follows: Self-Directed, Validators, Delegators and Avoiders – an overview of each type can be found on figure~\ref{fig:cutomer-types}.\\
As the name implies Self-Directed customers are highly independent and in most cases make financial decisions without consulting a financial adviser. They often have a strong interest in finances, understand financial products well and make research before making any decisions. Perhaps surprisingly, not all Self-Directed customers are willing to run financial risk for a higher return, and when it comes to more complex decisions such as pension or tax they seek advice from professionals. Compared to the other types they tend to have a better education and work full time.\\
The second type is Validators. They have the same kind of interest in economy as the Self-Directed but lack some confidence when it comes to making decisions. For moderately complex problems the Validators seek out financial advice, but are, in comparison to the Self-Directed type, more willing to take financial risks for a higher return. Out of the four types, Validators seem to have the healthiest economy.
The third type, Delegators, find finances boring and/or confusing. They would rather spend time on something else and is prepared to give up control to more knowledgeable people. When dealing with finances half of the Delegators wish to talk to other people and from a demographic perspective there is a slightly higher occurrence of women in this category.\\
The last type is more or less oblivious to finances. Avoiders do not have much trust in financial services or advisers, and as a result they tend to neglect their finances completely. Consequently, they usually have an unhealthy economy while their lack of financial knowledge make them more risk-averse because they are not able to grasp the repercussions of their actions \cite[p.~10-11]{ensor2006segmenting}.\\
According to the report the easiest way to spot which segment a given customer belongs to is through their behaviour, e.g. Validators are more likely to buy products through a financial adviser whereas the Self-Directed would probably do it online without consulting a professional. Furthermore, the various types seem to prefer different channels (ATM, internet, branches, etc.) and therefore this can also be used to uncover the type of a customer.


GRAPH HERE!


The customer segmentation and the fact that customers’ interest in personal financial matters vary a lot, needs to be taken into consideration because it will inevitably influence our findings. Hopefully, being able to make that distinction between different types of users will help us in making more informed decisions hence make better designs.


#High expectations. If the quality or the number of technological services do not fully live up to the customers expectations, there is a high risk of losing a customer. 
#Customer empowerment
#Our personal finances and the way we manage them are often reflected in our decisions.

\chapter{Establishing a Direction} (~10 pages)
This chapter outline our efforts to establish a direction in the domain of personal financial management in the home. Interviews and an exploratory workshop constitute the empirical foundation for our understanding of the domain. The interviews seek to create initial insights into how the users handle financial management with a focus on their behaviors in the home. The workshop also focuses on how the users handle their finances in the home but additionally provides insights into how the attendants would like future banking technology to look like and be integrated in the home.

\section{Preliminary Interviews}
This section presents the three preliminary interviews that were conducted in order to obtain knowledge about (our target group’s) personal financial management. We conducted an interview with a financial adviser, a woman living with her husband and two kids, and a young couple living together. The main findings/takeaways from these interviews are presented in separate sections with all interviewees anonymized in order to maintain integrity. The interview with the financial adviser was held in person and documented using voice recording and notes, while the interviews with our target group members were conducted via Skype using screen recording and phone using voice recording, both complemented with notes. The interview guides used for the interviews can be found in appendix x.


#maybe say something about the questionnaire used for screening
\subsection{Financial Adviser}
Prior to the interviews with our target group we conducted an unstructured interview \cite[chapter~7]{sharp2007interaction} with Michael; a 34-year-old senior adviser from Danske Bank with more than ten years of experience within financial counselling. The primary goal of the interview was to gain an overall understanding of how people manage financial matters on a daily basis, and how the relationship between a financial adviser and a regular customer is currently functioning. The interview took around 40 minutes.\\


After the introduction and the warm-up questions our main session started, and after some time it became relatively clear that many of the answers to our questions resided in the advancement of technology. Before his job at Danske Bank, Michael worked at a smaller bank and he described how he, on a daily basis, had more personal contact with the customers. He mainly ascribed this difference to the amount of financial services offered to customers of Danske Bank, as they now have the opportunity to handle simple financial tasks on their own. Even though it might seem a bit contradictory at first the wide range of services available to bank customers has resulted in a higher focus on customer care as the financial advisors no longer have to perform the same amount of trivial tasks. As Michael describes it: \emph{...a lot of our things [daily tasks] have changed because of IT solutions, I mean, the customers can actually do a lot [economic related tasks] at home...}. As described in section~\ref{sec:segmenting-financial-customers} this change can also be seen in the increased number of logins that Danske Bank is experiencing on weekly basis.\\
During our interview we also asked what he saw as the main reason for unfortunate economic situations and how this could lead to an unhealthy economy. In his perspective undesirable economic situations were often caused by a lack of framing (no budget), and the fact that future projections are difficult to make. Another, yet very important aspect, is how new (young) customers decide on which bank they want to take care of their money. Michael told us about how some people have chosen Danske Bank due to its technological offerings: \emph{“...many customers have opted for Danske Bank because of it [technological services], as others [banks] do not offer as advanced solutions”.}
Seeing how banks keep pushing “new” features to their digital platforms and how customers embrace these features by fast adoption, lead us to believe that self-service and customer empowerment is a key factor in future banking.
\subsection{Sabina Bruun / Family mother}
We conducted a semi-structured phone interview \cite[chapter~7]{sharp2007interaction} with Charlotte, a 28-year-old woman living in Western Jutland, Denmark, with her husband and two children. Charlotte works a part time job as a nurse and her husband works full time as a mason. The phone interview was performed on a thursday morning and took approximately 45 minutes. 


When asked to describe her economy, Charlotte quickly focused on the changes that had happened economically between her life as a student and a nurse. She used to plan her grocery shopping and make detailed budgets but has become unstructured in this regard and her priorities have changed: \emph{“... back then when we had no money we were really good at prioritising. I have been looking in offer catalogs, made meal planning and all those things but it all just went out the window”}. She now values vacations with her family highly and describes how they will even take unpaid leave to go on long trips. Her economic values and behavior have changed dramatically with the change in her life situation -- that is having kids and a reliable source of income. 
Charlotte values everyday financial insights because it makes her feel in control. She logs into her online bank daily to check up on transactions and make sure that everything is going according to the plan. She confirms that the correct amounts are withdrawn from her account for the purchases she makes and that her salary is deposited to her account etc. \emph{“For example just an hour ago, I ordered some new clothes for the kids online and then I go to see how it is going [on the netbank] quite instinctively. I do this because i like to be in control of the situation”}. Although Charlotte checks her transactions daily she does not calculate her weekly or monthly expenses in order to adjust her spending behavior but rather makes the adjustment based on intuition after glancing through her transactions. This habit of adapting her spending behavior reactively based on intuition is a way for her to stay in control after she stopped making budgets and knowing exactly how their money was spent.
Charlotte always uses her smartphone or iPad when interacting with her netbank. She leads a busy life so she logs on in quick sessions in between household tasks and as such fits her banking activities into the flow of her everyday activities and routines: \emph{“I often log on at the kitchen table. I would say that i am almost never sitting in the couch. We lead busy lives, when the kids are put to bed I have to do the laundry for example and then I will often sit at the kitchen table for five minutes [on the netbank]”}.
\subsection{Linn Helen and Klaus / Couple}
The last interview was a semi-structured interview and was conducted via Skype with Jennifer and Christian who live in Aalborg which is located in Northern Jutland in Denmark. Jennifer is 25 years old and works as a physiotherapist. Christian is 27 years old and also a physiotherapist but currently pursuing a career in teaching instead. The interview took approximately 40 minutes.

\section{Workshop}
This section presents the workshop that we conducted to gather further knowledge about how people handle their personal finances in the home and more importantly to obtain insights into how people would imagine future banking experiences in the home; both in terms of functionality and context integration. Knowledge about people's wants and desires can act as inspiration and guidelines in the design process and is thus very useful…?? 
The workshop was carried out in two parts, the first being a series of warm-up exercises and the second work with a self-developed kit, that we call Exploration Kit, which was designed to help participants express their ideas for future banking experiences.


The first half of the workshop was spent doing four exercises related to interactions with and feelings about economy. The point of these exercises was twofold; firstly it made the participants reflect upon their own economy in order to create a basis for idea generation with the exploration kit and secondly it acted as a way to gain knowledge about the participants’ attitudes towards economy and usage of current banking tools. 
The second half of the workshop was assigned to work with the Exploration Kit. The purpose of the kit was to enable the participants to come up with ideas for banking experiences in the home. Importantly the kit forced the participants to not only think of an abstract concept but also how it could be physically manifested in the home context. 


The workshop took place at Finlandsgade 21 in the Nygaard building on thursday the 9th of march 2017. The workshop was conducted in the evening and had a duration of approximately 2 hours. Ten people participated in the workshop, seven of which were male and three female. The ages ranged from 22 to 27 and the majority (seven out of ten) had a cohabitant or lived together with one or more people. All of the participants except one were university students and a little more than half of the students had a technical background whereas the other half was less tech-savvy.
\subsection{Warm-Up Exercises}
In order to establish an inspirational atmosphere and spark creativity we conducted a series of introductory exercises. These exercises aimed to capture some general knowledge about the participants’ background, technology usage and financial attitude. Many of the exercises was designed in the spirit of Gaver et. al’s Cultural Probes \cite{gaver1999design} as they strived to capture data in a more inspirational and imaginative manner.
#Briefly introduce exercises?
\subsubsection*{“Draw Your Economy”}
We initiated the workshop with the task to “draw your economy”. This exercise was very much inspired by Kaye et al. \cite[p.~522]{kaye2014money} and was intentionally very open as the participants were told they could draw whatever came into their minds. The goal of the exercise was to make the participants reflect upon their own economic situation in order for them to use this as a foundation for the later ideation with the Exploration Kit. Furthermore, it gave us insights into the participants’ mindsets towards economy. 


The drawings can generally be divided into two categories. The first category contains abstract drawings that try to convey the feeling the person is experiencing in relation to their economy, e.g. a man standing on top of the world or a man struggling to find water in the desert (see figure~\ref{fig:draw-your-economy}). The second category contains more concrete and diagrammatic drawings related to spending or the money flow, e.g diagrams showing the spendings account balance over time or diagrams showing how the monthly income is spent in relation to different categories such as housing costs, leisure and groceries. Some participants combined the two categories to convey their general feelings or mindset about economy while also hinting at how they spend their money. One participant, who combined the categories, drew a person floating down a river (a money stream) surrounded by food, gifts, clothes and so on.


The ways the participants think about economy and spend money are numerous. However, there is a tendency towards an either very positive or negative attitude regarding economy. Some participants portray their economy as struggling or unstable while others display joy and satisfaction. One participant drew himself on top of the world and explained that he was a big consumer and very deliberately purchased items related to his hobby which would result in positive emotional responses such as excitement or happiness. It was a common theme for people who had a positive attitude to focus on the possibilities and explicitly what made them happy. One participant valued holidays highly, another clothes and a third computer games and equipment. A participant with a negative attitude drew the Leaning Tower of Pisa and explained that he thought his economy was off balance because he did not care much about it and at times completely neglected it. Common for the ones with a negative attitude was the general dislike of economy as a subject and frequently neglecting it.


#Something about how the different customers segments become evident in this exercise, maybe?
\subsubsection*{Floor plan}
In order to get a better understanding of how people organize and interact with their economy in the context we asked them to draw a floorplan of their residence and place different markers, representing various technologies or mediums, on this floorplan.
As financial information is accessible from almost all kinds of technologies, it comes as no surprise that information is not strictly bound to a specific artifacts or locations. The artifacts used ranged from simple paper and Excel spreadsheets to the multipurpose smartphone. The increase of portability in technological devices has altered the way we connect with our economy and shows that – even though we are not completely aware of it – financial interactions are more omnipresent than ever before. Most of the participants used laptops, tablets and smartphones as a way of staying in touch with their economy, and no place in the home seemed to be “sacred”. The living room, kitchen and the bed seem to be most popular places to interact with economy, however only very few restricted their interaction with money to very specific places or rooms.


#Describe with home context theory
\subsubsection*{Emoticonometer}
In one of the exercises we asked the participants to express how they felt about their financial situation. Inspired by the Smileyometer \cite{read2006using}, we provided the participants with a set of emoticons and asked them to answer three questions, e.g. “how is your relationship with the bank”, using these emoticons. We decided to use emoticons instead of hand drawn smileys as we feel the average user, having varying drawing skills, will be able to express their emotional state towards economy more precisely. Also, since the emoticons embodies a wider and more diverse range of emotions it can no longer be characterized as a Likert scale. With this exercise we hoped to gain a better understanding of how people are emotionally engaged in different aspects of their economy and where there might be an opportunity for improvement. Based on the output from the workshop we see that people have mixed feelings about their economy (see figure~\ref{fig:emoticonometer}). The participants used very different emoticons for the same questions, however most of the participants used a somewhat positive emoticon to express their personal economy, whereas the topic of talking economy with others and the relationship with the bank were more diverse. This is very much in line with the first exercise where people drew their financial situation.
\subsubsection*{Voting}
In the last exercise we asked the participants to fill out a ballot paper where they indicated any technology they had used to manage their personal finances on that particular day. This resulted in the following distribution:


\begin{itemize}
        \item E-bank: 1
        \item Mobile e-bank: 3
        \item MobilePay: 5
        \item Creditcard: 8
        \item Cash: 1
        \item WeShare: 1
\end{itemize}


A clear pattern emerges showing that the old “technology” in the form of cash is on the retreat while the well established credit card technology is still the most prevalent. However, we see a rise in the adoption of new solutions namely MobilePay and mobile e-banking, which resonates well with the current trends of digitization. In this regard it is important to take the participants under study into account particularly their relatively young age. While young people are known to adopt new technologies faster, we believe that it is also part of a general tendency towards more rapid technology adoption.
#Maybe rewrite some of this. What are we trying to say finding wise?

#Privacy discussion: When and how should the data be visualized when multiple people are in the context. Need for abstract representations?


#Adaptation to multiple family members: When more people are present show more layers of information for the individuals or show common economy


#Data emergence


#UbiComp: The clock has strong links to ubiquitous computing as it is an internet-connected smart device that can update the information displayed as new data becomes available and potentially be connected to other relevant devices in the home. It is also remotely aware of presence in the room which allows it to display information whenever appropriate and fits well with Mark Weiser’s notion of calm technology as it is able to step completely into the background and disappear when it turns into an ordinary clock.
Emergent displays may be a way to achieve the calmness that is required and expected from domestic technology.
